- Catalyst Immediacy: 5/30
  * Earnings date Unknown. No recent headlines to assess narrative.
- Narrative Velocity: 5/25 
  * No headlines in last 14 days. Narrative velocity and specificity Unknown.
- Volatility Fit: 17/20
  * ATR% 4.92 supports capturing +10% within 30d if catalyst emerges. 
- Technical Alignment: 25/25
  * Strong breakout above prior range. Confirmed above 20/50d MAs. RSI overbought but can persist.

Verdict: WATCH

- Powerful technicals but narrative is a black box. Earnings date is key.

Setup: Breakout 

Spark: Unknown. Check for pending catalysts: earnings date, guidance, major contract, sector tailwinds.

Trap: Loss of 8.50 breakout level on a closing basis. 

Trade Plan:
- Entry: Buy break & hold above 9.20 on ≥1.5× volume. 
- Stop: 7.90 (below prior range + 1.2 ATR buffer).
- TP1: 9.90 (+1 ATR), TP2: 10.80 (+2 ATR). Trail stop after TP1.
- Position: Risk 1–2% per trade. Shares = $risk / (9.20 - 7.90).

Next steps:
- Confirm earnings date + check for prelim guidance (company IR, Nasdaq calendar).
- Pull 30d headlines from secondary source in case key events were missed.
- Monitor SEC filings for ATM / shelf offering language.
- Map overhead supply zones from prior consolidations and gap levels.
