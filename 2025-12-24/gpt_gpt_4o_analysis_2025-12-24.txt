### Rankings

**A) Top 1 for 7–10d:**  
None. No ticker meets the criteria for a BUY rating due to lack of catalysts and narrative flow.

**B) Top 2 for 30d:**  
None. No ticker meets the criteria for a BUY rating due to lack of catalysts and narrative flow.

**Notes:**  
LION lacks any immediate catalysts or narrative velocity, which severely limits its potential for a +10% move within either horizon despite strong technical alignment. The absence of headlines and unknown earnings date further weaken the case for a BUY rating.
