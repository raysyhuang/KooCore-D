## DUAL-HORIZON MOMENTUM AUDIT

### 1) Summary Table

| Ticker | Score_7-10d | Verdict_7-10d | Score_30d | Verdict_30d | Setup | Spark_7-10d | Trap | Entry_7-10d | Stop_7-10d | Spark_30d | Entry_30d | Stop_30d |
|--------|-------------|---------------|-----------|-------------|-------|-------------|------|-------------|------------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| LION | 52 | IGNORE | 58 | WATCH | Breakout | Catalyst unknown | RSI >84 overbought reversal | Break above $9.42 on 1.5x vol | $8.45 | Catalyst unknown | Break above $9.42 on 1.5x vol | $8.45 |

### 2) Rankings

**A) Top 1 for 7–10d:** None qualify for BUY. LION fails catalyst gate with unknown earnings and zero headlines despite strong technicals.

**B) Top 2 for 30d:** Only LION available at WATCH level. Missing second ticker for comparison, but LION's 25/100 completeness score prevents BUY rating despite breakout structure.

## DETAILED ANALYSIS: LION

**Horizon A: 7–10 Trading Days Score: 52/100**
- Catalyst Immediacy: 8/40 (Unknown earnings, zero headlines - major penalty)
- Narrative Velocity: 5/20 (No story flow, no recent coverage)
- Volatility Fit: 19/20 (4.92% ATR supports +10% move)
- Technical Alignment: 20/20 (Above MA20/MA50, clean breakout structure, RSI 84.1)

**Horizon B: 30 Calendar Days Score: 58/100**
- Catalyst Immediacy: 12/30 (Slightly more time for unknown catalyst to emerge)
- Narrative Velocity: 8/25 (Extended time window, but still no narrative foundation)
- Volatility Fit: 18/20 (ATR adequate for 30-day timeframe)
- Technical Alignment: 20/25 (Strong breakout confirmation, but RSI overbought concern)

**Verdict Rationale:**
- **7–10d: IGNORE** - Completeness score 25/100 triggers hard constraint. No identifiable catalyst despite 2.82 RVOL and breakout structure.
- **30d: WATCH** - Technical setup is clean (above both MAs, 26% 20-day return), but catalyst void prevents BUY rating.

**Key Risks:**
- RSI 84.1 suggests potential pullback risk
- Zero headline coverage creates information asymmetry
- Unknown earnings timing prevents catalyst planning

**Required Checks:**
- Confirm earnings date via company IR/Nasdaq calendar
- Pull 14-30d headlines from SEC filings, PR sources
- Check for upcoming catalysts: contracts, guidance, offerings
