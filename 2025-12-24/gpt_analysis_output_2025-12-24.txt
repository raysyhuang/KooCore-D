### Analysis for Ticker: LION

#### Scoring for 7–10 Trading Days Horizon

1. **Catalyst Immediacy (0–40):**  
   - Score: 5/40  
   - Rationale: No known earnings date and no recent headlines. Major penalty for lack of immediate catalysts.

2. **Narrative Velocity (0–20):**  
   - Score: 0/20  
   - Rationale: No recent headlines or narrative flow to support momentum.

3. **Volatility Fit (0–20):**  
   - Score: 15/20  
   - Rationale: ATR% of 4.92 supports potential for quick +10% move, but lack of narrative reduces confidence.

4. **Technical Alignment (0–20):**  
   - Score: 18/20  
   - Rationale: Strong technical setup with price above MA20 and MA50, indicating a breakout structure.

**Verdict 7–10d:** IGNORE

#### Scoring for 30 Calendar Days Horizon

   - Rationale: No narrative elements to drive sustained movement.

3. **Volatility Fit (0–20):**  
   - Score: 15/20  
   - Rationale: ATR% supports potential for +10% move over 30 days, but narrative weakness is a concern.

4. **Technical Alignment (0–25):**  
   - Score: 20/25  
   - Rationale: Strong technicals with a breakout setup, but lack of catalysts limits confidence.

### Rankings

A) **Top 1 for 7–10d:** None selected due to lack of sufficient scores and catalysts.

B) **Top 2 for 30d:** None selected due to lack of sufficient scores and catalysts.

### Notes

- **Spark:** No specific catalyst identified due to lack of headlines and unknown earnings.
- **Trap:** Loss of breakout level would invalidate the thesis.
- **Trade Plan:** Entry on break & hold above prior day high with stop 1.2× ATR below breakout level. Use standard TP1 and TP2 targets with position sizing to risk 1–2% of account per trade.

Given the lack of catalysts and narrative flow, LION is not suitable for a BUY rating in either the short or medium horizon.
