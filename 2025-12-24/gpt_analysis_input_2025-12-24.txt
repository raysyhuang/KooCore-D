DUAL-HORIZON MOMENTUM AUDIT (7–10 Trading Days + 30 Calendar Days)

Role: You are a momentum hedge fund analyst running a probability audit. You are NOT a price predictor.
You must be conservative with BUY ratings. You are scoring probability, not upside.

Objective:
For each ticker packet, estimate whether it has >60% probability of achieving:
A) +10% within the next 7–10 trading days (short horizon)
B) +10% within the next 30 calendar days (medium horizon)

You MUST produce two separate scores and verdicts (Short + Medium), then provide a combined ranking.
You may select at most:
- 1 BUY for the 7–10 day horizon
- 2 BUY for the 30 day horizon
All other ratings must be WATCH or IGNORE.

Hard Constraints (anti-hallucination):
1) You MUST NOT invent catalysts. If earnings date is Unknown or headlines are missing, you MUST penalize it.
2) Use the packet's "Catalyst completeness" as an evidence gate:
   - If Completeness Score < 55 → Verdict cannot be BUY (max WATCH) unless manual headlines provide a dated catalyst.
   - If Earnings is Unknown AND headline count (14d) = 0 → Default to IGNORE unless technicals are exceptional AND the risk plan is very clean.
3) Regime gate usage:
   - If Regime Gate OK is False, apply a -10 penalty to both horizons and tighten verdicts (prefer WATCH/IGNORE).
4) No more than the BUY limits above.
5) If Dilution risk flag = 1 (headline scan), cap Verdict at WATCH unless there is a clear positive catalyst that outweighs it.
6) For Breakouts, require structural confirmation: Above_MA20=1 and Above_MA50=1; otherwise downgrade Technical Alignment.

Scoring Rubric (must sum exactly to 100 for each horizon):

Horizon A: 7–10 Trading Days Score (0–100)
- Catalyst Immediacy (0–40)
  * Dated catalyst within 10 trading days gets the most credit.
  * Unknown earnings / weak headlines is a major penalty.
- Narrative Velocity (0–20)
  * Fresh, concentrated storyflow matters more than breadth.
- Volatility Fit (0–20)
  * ATR% must support +10% quickly; too low = low probability.
- Technical Alignment (0–20)
  * Must have a clean trigger and minimal overhead supply.

Horizon B: 30 Calendar Days Score (0–100)
- Catalyst Immediacy (0–30)
- Narrative Velocity (0–25)
- Volatility Fit (0–20)
- Technical Alignment (0–25)

Execution Rules:
- For each ticker: read Setup, metrics, completeness score + penalties, regime, headlines.
- Identify the best plausible catalyst path for 7–10d and for 30d separately.
  * If none exists, explicitly say "catalyst unknown" and penalize.
- Use the packet's "Standard trade plan template" as the base.
- Produce one Entry Trigger and one Stop Anchor per horizon (can be identical if appropriate).

BUY Gates (strict):
- 7–10d BUY requires: Total ≥ 78 AND Catalyst(7–10d) ≥ 24 AND Technical(7–10d) ≥ 14.
- 30d BUY requires: Total ≥ 75 AND Catalyst(30d) ≥ 18 AND Technical(30d) ≥ 18.
If a name misses the gate, verdict must be WATCH/IGNORE even if it "looks good."

Output Format (STRICT):

1) Summary Table (one row per ticker):
Ticker | Score_7-10d | Verdict_7-10d | Score_30d | Verdict_30d | Setup | Spark_7-10d | Trap | Entry_7-10d | Stop_7-10d | Spark_30d | Entry_30d | Stop_30d

2) Rankings:
A) Top 1 for 7–10d and why (1–2 sentences)
B) Top 2 for 30d and why (1–2 sentences)

Notes:
- "Spark" must be a real trigger (dated event, headline-driven narrative, or technical trigger with volume).
- "Trap" must be the clearest invalidation (failed breakout, loss of key level, regime risk, dilution risk, etc.).
- Keep wording short and decision-grade.
- If evidence is insufficient, say so and downgrade.

Now analyze the following ticker packets:

==============================
TICKER: LION
==============================

Role: Momentum hedge fund analyst. You are running a probability audit (NOT a price predictor).
Objective: Decide if LION has >60% probability of achieving +10% within 30 calendar days.

Hard constraints:
- You MUST penalize "Unknown" earnings + missing headlines (no assuming hidden catalysts).
- You MUST still score based on tape structure: RVOL, ATR%, RSI, distance to 52W high, setup type.
- You MUST output at most 2 BUY ratings across the entire batch (if you are given multiple tickers).
- If catalyst data is weak, default to WATCH/IGNORE even if technicals look good.
- If Dilution risk flag = 1 (headline scan), cap Verdict at WATCH unless there is a clear positive catalyst that outweighs it.
- For Breakouts, require structural confirmation: Above_MA20=1 and Above_MA50=1; otherwise downgrade Technical Alignment.

Inputs:
Market regime snapshot (best-effort):
- Regime data insufficient; skipping gate.
- Regime Gate OK: True

Earnings (best-effort): Unknown

Screener metrics:
- Last: 8.98
- RVOL: 2.82
- ATR%: 4.92 (≈ $0.44 ATR/day)
- RSI14: 84.1
- Dist_to_52W_High%: 2.92

- MA20: 7.83
- MA50: 7.05
- Above_MA20: 1 (1=yes, 0=no)
- Above_MA50: 1 (1=yes, 0=no)
- Ret20d%: 26.12%
- Setup: Breakout
- Score: 23.35
- Leveraged ETF: NO
- Dilution risk flag (headline scan): 0
- Catalyst tags (headline scan): None


Catalyst completeness (penalize Unknowns):
- Completeness Score: 25/100
- Earnings known: False (earnings=Unknown)
- Recent headline count (14d): 0
- Manual headlines: False
- Penalties:
  * Earnings date Unknown (penalize catalyst clarity).
  * No recent headlines found (penalize narrative visibility).


Recent headlines:
- (No headlines returned. Treat catalysts as Unknown. Check: earnings guidance, SEC filings, major contracts, sector/BTC correlation, terminal/X headlines.)

Standard trade plan template (by setup):
- Entry: Break & hold above prior day high OR key resistance on ≥1.5× volume; avoid chasing if >2× ATR extension.
- Stop: 1.2× ATR below breakout level (or below prior day low if tighter and logical).
- TPs: TP1 = +1.0× ATR, TP2 = +2.0× ATR; trail stop after TP1.
- Position sizing: risk 1–2% of account per trade. Shares = (AccountRisk$) / (StopDistance$).


If data is missing, explicitly state Unknown and list checks:
- Confirm next earnings date (company IR site / Nasdaq earnings calendar).
- Pull 14–30d headlines from a second source (SEC, PR, major outlets, terminal).
- Check upcoming: FDA/clinical readouts, contracts, secondary offering/ATM, lockup expiry, guidance updates.
- Check technical context: multi-year resistance, gap levels, supply zones, post-earnings drift behavior.

Scoring rubric (0–100):
- Catalyst Immediacy (0–30)
- Narrative Velocity (0–25)
- Volatility Fit (0–20)
- Technical Alignment (0–25)

Output format (STRICT):
- Total Score: X/100
- Verdict: BUY / WATCH / IGNORE
- Setup: Breakout or Reversal
- 1-line Spark: what specifically could trigger +10%
- 1-line Trap: what invalidates the thesis
- Trade Plan: entry trigger, stop anchor, TP1/TP2, position size rule (risk 1–2%)
