==============================
TICKER: TVTX
==============================

Role: Momentum hedge fund analyst. You are running a probability audit (NOT a price predictor).
Objective: Decide if TVTX has >60% probability of achieving +10% within 30 calendar days.

Hard constraints:
- You MUST penalize "Unknown" earnings + missing headlines (no assuming hidden catalysts).
- You MUST still score based on tape structure: RVOL, ATR%, RSI, distance to 52W high, setup type.
- You MUST output at most 2 BUY ratings across the entire batch (if you are given multiple tickers).
- If catalyst data is weak, default to WATCH/IGNORE even if technicals look good.
- If Dilution risk flag = 1 (headline scan), cap Verdict at WATCH unless there is a clear positive catalyst that outweighs it.
- For Breakouts, require structural confirmation: Above_MA20=1 and Above_MA50=1; otherwise downgrade Technical Alignment.

Inputs:
Market regime snapshot (best-effort):
- SPY=690.38 vs MA20=681.15 (OK); VIX=13.47 (<= 25.00 is OK).
- Regime Gate OK: True

Earnings (best-effort): Unknown

Screener metrics:
- Last: 40.28
- RVOL: 2.19
- ATR%: 4.91 (≈ $1.98 ATR/day)
- RSI14: 67.7
- Dist_to_52W_High%: 4.39

- MA20: 35.23
- MA50: 33.43
- Above_MA20: 1 (1=yes, 0=no)
- Above_MA50: 1 (1=yes, 0=no)
- Ret20d%: 11.86%
- Setup: Breakout
- Score: 22.87
- Leveraged ETF: NO
- Dilution risk flag (headline scan): 0
- Catalyst tags (headline scan): None


Catalyst completeness (penalize Unknowns):
- Completeness Score: 25/100
- Earnings known: False (earnings=Unknown)
- Recent headline count (14d): 0
- Manual headlines: False
- Penalties:
  * Earnings date Unknown (penalize catalyst clarity).
  * No recent headlines found (penalize narrative visibility).


Recent headlines:
- (No headlines returned. Treat catalysts as Unknown. Check: earnings guidance, SEC filings, major contracts, sector/BTC correlation, terminal/X headlines.)

Standard trade plan template (by setup):
- Entry: Break & hold above prior day high OR key resistance on ≥1.5× volume; avoid chasing if >2× ATR extension.
- Stop: 1.2× ATR below breakout level (or below prior day low if tighter and logical).
- TPs: TP1 = +1.0× ATR, TP2 = +2.0× ATR; trail stop after TP1.
- Position sizing: risk 1–2% of account per trade. Shares = (AccountRisk$) / (StopDistance$).


If data is missing, explicitly state Unknown and list checks:
- Confirm next earnings date (company IR site / Nasdaq earnings calendar).
- Pull 14–30d headlines from a second source (SEC, PR, major outlets, terminal).
- Check upcoming: FDA/clinical readouts, contracts, secondary offering/ATM, lockup expiry, guidance updates.
- Check technical context: multi-year resistance, gap levels, supply zones, post-earnings drift behavior.

Scoring rubric (0–100):
- Catalyst Immediacy (0–30)
- Narrative Velocity (0–25)
- Volatility Fit (0–20)
- Technical Alignment (0–25)

Output format (STRICT):
- Total Score: X/100
- Verdict: BUY / WATCH / IGNORE
- Setup: Breakout or Reversal
- 1-line Spark: what specifically could trigger +10%
- 1-line Trap: what invalidates the thesis
- Trade Plan: entry trigger, stop anchor, TP1/TP2, position size rule (risk 1–2%)
