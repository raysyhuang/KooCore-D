# DUAL-HORIZON MOMENTUM AUDIT: TVTX

## INDIVIDUAL ANALYSIS

### TVTX – Breakout Setup

**Regime Check:** ✓ SPY above MA20, VIX 13.47 (benign)

**Catalyst Audit:**
- Earnings: **Unknown** (major penalty)
- Headlines (14d): **0** (major penalty)
- Completeness Score: **25/100** (fails >55 threshold)
- **Catalyst Status: UNKNOWN** – No dated events, no narrative drivers visible

**Required Checks (all return Unknown):**
- Earnings date: Unknown (check IR/Nasdaq calendar)
- SEC filings (14–30d): Not provided
- Clinical readouts/FDA: Not provided (biotech ticker suggests relevance)
- Guidance/offerings: Not provided
- Sector catalysts: Not provided

**Technical Structure:**
- Above MA20 ✓ (40.28 vs 35.23)
- Above MA50 ✓ (40.28 vs 33.43)
- Breakout confirmation: **VALID** (both MAs cleared)
- RSI 67.7: Warm but not overbought
- 20d return: +11.86% (recent strength)
- Distance to 52W high: 4.39% (near resistance)
- RVOL 2.19: Strong participation
- ATR% 4.91: Adequate volatility for +10% move

**Risk Flags:**
- Dilution risk: 0 (clean)
- Regime gate: OK
- **Critical flaw:** Zero catalyst visibility despite biotech sector (typically event-driven)

## HORIZON A: 7–10 TRADING DAYS

**Scoring Breakdown:**

| Component | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Catalyst Immediacy** | 8/40 | Unknown earnings, zero headlines. No dated catalyst within 10 days. Biotech without visible readout = blind trade. |
| **Narrative Velocity** | 6/20 | RVOL 2.19 shows tape interest, but no story. 20d momentum exists but fading without fresh fuel. |
| **Volatility Fit** | 16/20 | ATR% 4.91 supports +10% in 7–10d mechanically. 2× ATR = ~9.8%, feasible. |
| **Technical Alignment** | 13/20 | Breakout structurally confirmed (above both MAs), but 4.39% from 52W high = overhead supply risk. RSI 67.7 limits upside room. |

**Total Score: 43/100**

**Verdict: IGNORE**
- **Fails BUY gate:** Score 43 << 78 required; Catalyst 8 << 24 required
- **Fails WATCH threshold:** Completeness 25 < 55; no catalyst path identifiable
- **Rationale:** Biotech breakout with zero event visibility = speculative tape chase. 7–10d window too short without known catalyst.

**Spark (7–10d):** Continuation squeeze above $41.50 (52W high zone) on >3× volume – **but catalyst unknown, purely technical.**

**Trap (7–10d):** Break below $38.30 (prior day low / MA20 zone) or any dilution/offering headline.

**Entry Trigger (7–10d):** Break & hold above $41.50 on ≥2× volume (chasing 52W high without catalyst = high risk).

**Stop Anchor (7–10d):** $38.00 (1.2× ATR = $2.38 below entry ≈ $39.12 breakout level).

## HORIZON B: 30 CALENDAR DAYS

**Scoring Breakdown:**

| Component | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Catalyst Immediacy** | 12/30 | 30d window increases odds of *something* (earnings, FDA, partnership), but currently Unknown. Biotech sector = event-driven; absence of visibility is disqualifying. |
| **Narrative Velocity** | 10/25 | Tape strength (RVOL 2.19, +11.86% 20d) suggests institutional accumulation, but no public story. Momentum could persist or evaporate. |
| **Volatility Fit** | 16/20 | ATR% 4.91 × 6 weeks ≈ 29% potential range; +10% well within statistical envelope. |
| **Technical Alignment** | 16/25 | Breakout valid, but 52W high proximity + RSI 67.7 = limited technical runway. Needs fundamental catalyst to clear resistance. |

**Total Score: 54/100**

**Verdict: IGNORE**
- **Fails BUY gate:** Score 54 << 75 required; Catalyst 12 << 18 required
- **Fails WATCH threshold:** Completeness 25 < 55; no catalyst path
- **Rationale:** 30d window doesn't rescue a blind biotech trade. Without earnings date or clinical milestone, probability of +10% is speculative.

**Spark (30d):** Unannounced earnings beat, FDA milestone, or partnership PR – **all currently Unknown.**

**Trap (30d):** Dilution announcement, failed breakout below $38, or sector rotation out of small-cap biotech.

**Entry Trigger (30d):** Wait for catalyst announcement + break above $41.50, OR scale in at $38–39 MA20 support *only if* earnings date surfaces.

**Stop Anchor (30d):** $36.50 (below MA50 $33.43 + 1 ATR buffer = invalidates breakout structure).

## RANKINGS

### A) Top 1 for 7–10 Days
**NONE SELECTED (0 BUY ratings issued)**
- TVTX scores 43/100 and fails all BUY gates due to **complete absence of catalyst visibility** despite valid breakout structure. A biotech 4% from 52W highs with unknown earnings and zero headlines is a speculative tape chase, not a probability-weighted trade.

### B) Top 2 for 30 Days
**NONE SELECTED (0 BUY ratings issued)**
- TVTX scores 54/100 for 30d horizon. While the longer window theoretically allows for an unannounced catalyst to emerge, the **Completeness Score of 25/100 disqualifies it from BUY consideration** per hard constraints. The technical setup is valid, but without a known earnings date, FDA readout, or partnership timeline, the trade relies entirely on hope rather than edge.

---

## FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**PASS on TVTX for both horizons.**

**Action Items Before Reconsidering:**
1. Confirm next earnings date (likely Q4 2024 or Q1 2025 report).
2. Check ClinicalTrials.gov for trial readout timelines (biotech ticker).
3. Scan SEC for recent 8-K filings (partnerships, offerings, milestones).
4. Monitor for any conference presentations or investor day announcements.

**If a dated catalyst surfaces within 30 days AND price holds above $38 (MA20), reassess with Catalyst Immediacy score ≥18 and upgrade to WATCH or BUY accordingly.**
