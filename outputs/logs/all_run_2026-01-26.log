BULL/BEAR DEBATE RESULTS
============================================================

1. MS: 🟢 BUY (Score: 8.8, Bull: 7.6, Bear: 6.4)
   └─ The bull case has stronger near-term technical evidence: a confirmed 20-day brea...
   └─ Risks: Failed breakout/mean reversion risk given proximity to 52-week highs and RSI in the low-60s, Catalyst timing uncertainty (earnings date unknown; SpaceX IPO headline may not translate into near-term P&L impact) and limited options confirmation (low unusual volume)

2. CADE: 🟡 HOLD (Score: 8.0, Bull: 6.9, Bear: 6.6)
   └─ The bull case has solid technical/trend evidence (price above key MAs, elevated ...
   └─ Risks: Failed breakout/mean reversion risk given negative breakout_strength_atr and lack of 20-day breakout confirmation, Event risk from unknown earnings timing; elevated IV implies larger-than-normal downside if an adverse surprise occurs

3. DAL: 🟡 HOLD (Score: 8.0, Bull: 6.8, Bear: 7.2)
   └─ The bull case has credible technical support (price above key MAs, rising partic...
   └─ Risks: Failed breakout/overhead supply near the 52-week high leading to chop or pullback over the next 1-2 weeks, Event/timing risk from unknown earnings date and elevated implied/realized volatility increasing gap risk

4. RKLB: 🟢 BUY (Score: 7.8, Bull: 7.7, Bear: 6.4)
   └─ The bull case has stronger near-term evidence: price is in a clear uptrend above...
   └─ Risks: Neutron development/execution risk (testing failure could imply schedule slip/cost increases and trigger further de-risking), Near-highs positioning without breakout confirmation (rejection at resistance/mean reversion if incremental buyers fade; volume below average)

5. MU: 🟢 BUY (Score: 7.8, Bull: 7.6, Bear: 6.6)
   └─ The bull case has stronger objective evidence on trend quality (price above key ...
   └─ Risks: Failed breakout/near-term stall: price remains below prior Donchian highs (~351) with breakout model negative, increasing odds of chop or pullback, Volatility/event-risk asymmetry: high realized/IV without a known scheduled catalyst can resolve downward quickly if sentiment cools

6. XYL: 🟡 HOLD (Score: 7.7, Bull: 7.3, Bear: 6.6)
   └─ The bull case has solid technical evidence (confirmed Donchian breakout, trend a...
   └─ Risks: Volatility/range constraint: a +10% move in 7 sessions is ~6+ ATR and statistically demanding without a volatility regime expansion, Supply/failed-breakout risk near the 52-week high leading to consolidation or reversal after an extended run above key moving averages

7. STE: 🟡 HOLD (Score: 7.7, Bull: 7.2, Bear: 6.8)
   └─ The bull case has solid technical evidence (trend alignment and a 20-day Donchia...
   └─ Risks: Failed breakout/near-52w-high rejection leading to a pullback or multi-day consolidation, Lack of volume and options participation reduces odds of a sharp 7-day continuation; unknown earnings/catalyst timing adds event risk

8. NUE: 🟡 HOLD (Score: 7.7, Bull: 7.2, Bear: 6.8)
   └─ Technicals support an ongoing uptrend (20-day Donchian breakout and price above ...
   └─ Risks: Failed breakout/near-high mean reversion given modest breakout strength and sub-1.0 volume ratio vs 20d, Catalyst uncertainty (unknown earnings date/no headlines) combined with elevated implied volatility increasing gap risk

9. GS: 🟡 HOLD (Score: 7.5, Bull: 7.3, Bear: 6.6)
   └─ The bull case has stronger technical evidence (confirmed Donchian breakout, clea...
   └─ Risks: Failed breakout/mean reversion from near-52-week highs with RSI elevated, leading to a quick drawdown that overwhelms the short-horizon upside thesis, Options market skew (low call/put, notable put volume) and high implied volatility amplifying downside on any negative macro/headline shock

10. CBRE: 🟡 HOLD (Score: 7.5, Bull: 7.2, Bear: 6.6)
   └─ Technicals support continuation (20-day Donchian breakout, price above key MAs, ...
   └─ Risks: Failed breakout / profit-taking near 52-week highs leading to mean reversion toward MA20/MA50, Event/catalyst uncertainty (unknown earnings date, limited company-specific news) increasing gap-risk and reducing odds of a rapid continuation

BULL/BEAR DEBATE RESULTS
============================================================

1. MS: 🟢 BUY (Score: 9.4, Bull: 7.8, Bear: 6.2)
   └─ The bull case presents stronger, more directly observable evidence: a clean 20D ...
   └─ Risks: Breakout failure/mean reversion given extension above MA10/20/50 and elevated 5D realized volatility, Event-risk ambiguity (earnings timing unknown) and mixed news tone could trigger a fast reversal near 52-week highs

2. XYL: 🟢 BUY (Score: 8.4, Bull: 7.6, Bear: 6.4)
   └─ The bull case is better supported by observable, near-term evidence: a clean 20-...
   └─ Risks: Breakout failure/mean reversion: proximity to 52-week highs and elevated RSI can lead to stalling or a pullback that negates the 7-day +10% objective, Catalyst/event risk and information gaps: unknown earnings timing and no sentiment/headline visibility increase gap risk and reduce confidence in sustained momentum

3. STE: 🟢 BUY (Score: 8.2, Bull: 7.6, Bear: 6.4)
   └─ The bull case has stronger objective evidence via trend alignment (above key MAs...
   └─ Risks: Failed breakout/false move risk due to below-average recent volume (3d/20d ~0.85) and proximity to 52-week highs inviting profit-taking, Upside target difficulty: +10% in 7 sessions implies ~4.8 ATR move, less likely without a clear catalyst or supportive options/flow

4. CADE: 🟡 HOLD (Score: 8.0, Bull: 6.9, Bear: 6.6)
   └─ The bull case has solid technical evidence (clean MA stack, elevated recent volu...
   └─ Risks: Failure to clear ~$46 resistance (Donchian prior high) leading to consolidation or pullback from near-52w-high levels, Lack of a defined near-term catalyst (earnings date unknown) reduces odds of a fast +10% impulse; options flow does not indicate strong chase demand

5. DAL: 🟡 HOLD (Score: 8.0, Bull: 7.2, Bear: 6.8)
   └─ The bull case has solid evidence for trend continuation (price above key MAs, ne...
   └─ Risks: Failed breakout/rejection near Donchian resistance (~73.16) leading to a quick pullback despite the uptrend, Event-risk ambiguity (earnings tagged but date unknown) combined with elevated implied volatility, increasing gap risk and reducing edge

6. MU: 🟢 BUY (Score: 7.8, Bull: 7.6, Bear: 6.4)
   └─ The bull case has stronger near-term evidence: MU is in a clear uptrend above ke...
   └─ Risks: Failed push at/near 52-week highs leading to mean reversion (RSI ~68, breakout module not confirming a fresh breakout), No clearly defined scheduled catalyst; with high implied volatility, realized move may underdeliver and trigger profit-taking/vol crush dynamics

7. CBRE: 🟡 HOLD (Score: 7.7, Bull: 7.2, Bear: 7.0)
   └─ The bull case has solid technical evidence (fresh 20D breakout, price above key ...
   └─ Risks: Failed breakout/profit-taking near 52-week highs leading to a pullback toward MA10/MA20 within the 7-day window, Lack of identifiable near-term catalyst and weak options/volume confirmation causing upside to stall and volatility to mean-revert

8. GS: 🟡 HOLD (Score: 7.6, Bull: 7.2, Bear: 6.6)
   └─ Technicals support continuation (clean 20-day breakout, strong trend alignment, ...
   └─ Risks: Failed breakout/mean reversion risk given extended price vs MAs and near-52W-high positioning with elevated realized volatility, Options market skew to near-dated puts and unknown earnings timing could amplify downside/whipsaw in the 7-day window

9. NUE: 🟡 HOLD (Score: 7.5, Bull: 7.4, Bear: 6.8)
   └─ The bull case has solid technical evidence (20-day breakout, price above key MAs...
   └─ Risks: False/weak breakout risk given sub-1.0 3d/20d volume ratio and modest breakout strength, leading to quick mean reversion, Near-term upside capped by proximity to 52-week high and lack of a time-bound catalyst; 1–2 ATR pullback could derail a +10% weekly target

10. RKLB: 🟡 HOLD (Score: 7.2, Bull: 7.3, Bear: 6.8)
   └─ The bull case has credible trend support and a near-term narrative catalyst (MS ...
   └─ Risks: Neutron execution/headline risk (additional negative testing updates could drive sharp downside given elevated implied/realized volatility), Failed breakout/mean reversion risk near resistance (~52-week high/Donchian levels) with RSI elevated and volume not confirming
