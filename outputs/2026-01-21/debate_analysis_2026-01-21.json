          "key_points": [
            "No breakout confirmation despite being near highs: breakout_score 0.0 and is_breakout_20 false; breakout_strength_atr -0.9319 with Donchian20/55 prev at 351.23 vs current 336.63 suggests price is below prior channel highs, increasing odds of consolidation rather than a momentum continuation to +10%.",
            "Overextension/mean-reversion risk: RSI14 is 68.36 (elevated) and price is above MA10/MA20/MA50; combined with dist_to_52w_high_pct 4.16, upside may be harder near resistance while downside from profit-taking can be swift.",
            "Weak volume confirmation: volume_ratio_3d_to_20d is 0.72, indicating the recent push is occurring on lighter-than-average volume, which can precede failed breakouts or pullbacks.",
            "High implied volatility raises hurdle and tail risk: implied_volatility ~1.0705 suggests the market is pricing large swings; if no catalyst materializes, MU can drift or drop while options-implied expectations were too high (risk of disappointment/volatility compression).",
            "Catalyst and sentiment data gaps increase uncertainty: earnings_date is Unknown and sentiment_data_available is false, so near-term event risk (positive or negative) is not well-bounded; this uncertainty reduces confidence in a timed +10% target within 7 sessions.",
            "Crowded bullish narrative risk: headlines skew strongly positive (multiple bullish AI/HBM articles and insider-buying coverage), which can set up asymmetric downside if expectations are already saturated and incremental news fails to exceed them."
