            "Limited near-term upside / resistance risk: price is within 5% of the 52-week high (dist_to_52w_high_pct 2.46) and Donchian prior highs sit at 108.54 (20/55), so a quick +10% would require a clean break well above recent channel highs.",
            "Breakout not confirmed and momentum is fading: breakout_score 0.0 with is_breakout_20=false and breakout_strength_atr -1.2686; momentum also shows ret5_atr_units -0.51, suggesting recent returns have been weak relative to ATR despite being above key MAs.",
            "Overbought/mean-reversion setup with weak participation: RSI14 68.51 combined with subpar volume (volume_ratio_3d_to_20d 0.75) increases the risk of a pullback or churn instead of a sustained push higher.",
            "Catalyst and event-data gaps increase downside asymmetry: earnings_date is Unknown and there are no headlines/catalyst sources; without a known positive catalyst, the probability of a rapid +10% move is lower while surprise risk remains.",
            "Options data is not supportive of a bullish impulse: options_score 0.0, unusual_volume_multiple 0.01, and no notable contracts; this suggests a lack of observable speculative demand that often accompanies sharp upside moves."
