TICKER: VRT
==============================

Role: Momentum hedge fund analyst. You are running a probability audit (NOT a price predictor).
Objective: Decide if VRT has >60% probability of achieving +10% within 30 calendar days.

Hard constraints:
- You MUST penalize "Unknown" earnings + missing headlines (no assuming hidden catalysts).
- You MUST still score based on tape structure: RVOL, ATR%, RSI, distance to 52W high, setup type.
- You MUST output at most 2 BUY ratings across the entire batch (if you are given multiple tickers).
- If catalyst data is weak, default to WATCH/IGNORE even if technicals look good.
- If Dilution risk flag = 1 (headline scan), cap Verdict at WATCH unless there is a clear positive catalyst that outweighs it.
- For Breakouts, require structural confirmation: Above_MA20=1 and Above_MA50=1; otherwise downgrade Technical Alignment.

Inputs:
Market regime snapshot (best-effort):
- SPY=677.62 vs MA20=690.32 (RISK-OFF); VIX=21.77 (<= 25.00 is OK).
- Regime Gate OK: False

Recent headlines:
- (No headlines returned. Treat catalysts as Unknown. Check: earnings guidance, SEC filings, major contracts, sector/BTC correlation, terminal/X headlines.)

Standard trade plan template (by setup):
- Entry: Reclaim MA20 (or prior swing level) AND RSI curl up; confirm with a green day + elevated volume.
- Stop: Below recent swing low OR 1.0–1.3× ATR below entry (whichever is tighter and logical).
- TPs: TP1 = MA50 / prior supply zone, TP2 = gap-fill / next resistance; reduce into strength.
- Position sizing: risk 1–2% of account per trade. Shares = (AccountRisk$) / (StopDistance$).


If data is missing, explicitly state Unknown and list checks:
- Confirm next earnings date (company IR site / Nasdaq earnings calendar).
- Pull 14–30d headlines from a second source (SEC, PR, major outlets, terminal).
- Check upcoming: FDA/clinical readouts, contracts, secondary offering/ATM, lockup expiry, guidance updates.
- Check technical context: multi-year resistance, gap levels, supply zones, post-earnings drift behavior.

TICKER: ARI
==============================

Role: Momentum hedge fund analyst. You are running a probability audit (NOT a price predictor).
Objective: Decide if ARI has >60% probability of achieving +10% within 30 calendar days.

Hard constraints:
- You MUST penalize "Unknown" earnings + missing headlines (no assuming hidden catalysts).
- You MUST still score based on tape structure: RVOL, ATR%, RSI, distance to 52W high, setup type.
- You MUST output at most 2 BUY ratings across the entire batch (if you are given multiple tickers).
- If catalyst data is weak, default to WATCH/IGNORE even if technicals look good.
- If Dilution risk flag = 1 (headline scan), cap Verdict at WATCH unless there is a clear positive catalyst that outweighs it.
- For Breakouts, require structural confirmation: Above_MA20=1 and Above_MA50=1; otherwise downgrade Technical Alignment.

  * Earnings date Unknown (penalize catalyst clarity).
  * No recent headlines found (penalize narrative visibility).


Recent headlines:
- (No headlines returned. Treat catalysts as Unknown. Check: earnings guidance, SEC filings, major contracts, sector/BTC correlation, terminal/X headlines.)

Standard trade plan template (by setup):
- Entry: Reclaim MA20 (or prior swing level) AND RSI curl up; confirm with a green day + elevated volume.
- Stop: Below recent swing low OR 1.0–1.3× ATR below entry (whichever is tighter and logical).
- TPs: TP1 = MA50 / prior supply zone, TP2 = gap-fill / next resistance; reduce into strength.
- Position sizing: risk 1–2% of account per trade. Shares = (AccountRisk$) / (StopDistance$).


If data is missing, explicitly state Unknown and list checks:
- Confirm next earnings date (company IR site / Nasdaq earnings calendar).
- Pull 14–30d headlines from a second source (SEC, PR, major outlets, terminal).
- Check upcoming: FDA/clinical readouts, contracts, secondary offering/ATM, lockup expiry, guidance updates.
- Check technical context: multi-year resistance, gap levels, supply zones, post-earnings drift behavior.

TICKER: QCRH
==============================

Role: Momentum hedge fund analyst. You are running a probability audit (NOT a price predictor).
Objective: Decide if QCRH has >60% probability of achieving +10% within 30 calendar days.

Hard constraints:
- You MUST penalize "Unknown" earnings + missing headlines (no assuming hidden catalysts).
- You MUST still score based on tape structure: RVOL, ATR%, RSI, distance to 52W high, setup type.
- You MUST output at most 2 BUY ratings across the entire batch (if you are given multiple tickers).
- If catalyst data is weak, default to WATCH/IGNORE even if technicals look good.
- If Dilution risk flag = 1 (headline scan), cap Verdict at WATCH unless there is a clear positive catalyst that outweighs it.
- For Breakouts, require structural confirmation: Above_MA20=1 and Above_MA50=1; otherwise downgrade Technical Alignment.

Inputs:
Market regime snapshot (best-effort):
- SPY=677.62 vs MA20=690.32 (RISK-OFF); VIX=21.77 (<= 25.00 is OK).
