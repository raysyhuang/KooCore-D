            "Crowding/whipsaw risk from derivatives: call_put_ratio is very high (8.93) while implied_volatility is elevated (0.672), which can reflect crowded bullish positioning and higher odds of sharp reversals that prevent a clean +10% follow-through.",
            "Catalyst visibility is weak: headlines are empty and earnings_date is Unknown, so there is no identified near-term positive catalyst; unknown event timing adds downside surprise risk within a 7-trading-day window.",
            "Sentiment is a data gap: sentiment_data_available is false with explicit gaps noted, so there’s no confirmation that broader sentiment supports continuation; lack of sentiment evidence increases uncertainty around a sustained breakout."
