            "No confirmed breakout: breakout score is 0.0 and price (69.23) is below prior Donchian 20/55 level (71.5); breakout_strength_atr is negative (-0.588), which can signal a failed/unfinished breakout and higher pullback risk.",
            "Volatility regime increases drawdown odds: realized_vol_5d_ann_pct is 142.31% with ATR14=3.8607 (~5.58% of price), so a routine 1–2 ATR move down over a week is plausible and could negate the required +10% path.",
            "Options confirmation is weak: unusual_volume_multiple is only 0.44 despite call/put >1 (1.20), implying no strong unusual activity backing the move; this can be consistent with crowded/late momentum rather than fresh accumulation.",
            "Catalyst and sentiment visibility gaps: no headlines provided, catalyst_tags empty, earnings date is unknown, and sentiment data is unavailable—reducing confidence in timing a catalyst-driven continuation and increasing event-risk uncertainty."
