          "argument": "XPOF is set up for asymmetric downside over the next 7 trading days because it is trading very close to its 52-week high (3.39% below) without confirming breakout behavior, while realized volatility is extremely elevated. With earnings scheduled for 2026-02-26 and consensus EPS still negative (eps_estimate: -0.0342), the near-term path is dominated by event risk where even “not bad” results can trigger profit-taking given the extended trend above key moving averages.\n\nTechnically, the stock look",

            "Earnings catalyst risk within the 7-day window: earnings_date=2026-02-26 with eps_estimate=-0.0342; negative EPS expectations increase downside sensitivity to any miss or cautious commentary.",
            "Near 52-week high but no confirmed breakout: within_5pct_52w_high=true and dist_to_52w_high_pct=3.39, yet is_breakout_20=false and breakout_strength_atr=-0.1053 (price below prior Donchian levels), implying resistance overhead and higher odds of rejection than continuation.",
            "High volatility raises drawdown risk and makes +10% harder to “hold”: realized_vol_5d_ann_pct=94.53 and atr14=16.3374 (~9.35% ATR%); large daily ranges increase the probability of a sharp adverse move around earnings.",
            "Momentum is penalized by volatility: momentum_adj=-0.75 with 'elevated_volatility_penalty', indicating recent gains may be less reliable and more mean-reversion-prone.",
            "Volume confirmation is weak: volume_ratio_3d_to_20d=0.89 suggests the latest move lacks strong participation, reducing odds of a sustained breakout to +10% in 7 sessions.",
            "Sentiment data gap is itself a risk: sentiment_data_available=false and sentiment_score capped; inability to verify news/social tone increases uncertainty around an earnings-driven move.",
            "Options skew looks one-sided without fresh flow: call_put_ratio=5.23 but unusual_volume_multiple=0.06 and no notable_contracts listed; this can indicate crowded bullish positioning that can unwind quickly on a catalyst."
